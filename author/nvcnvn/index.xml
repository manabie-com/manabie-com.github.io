In this series, we will show how we develop and do integration tests using local k8s. The first part will show how we simulate the HTTPS certificate issue flow to allow our Platform engineers to test their config and allow our Front-end engineers to connect their application to local server with a self-signed HTTPS certificate.</description></item><item><title>Snapshot test your Postgresql in Golang pgx driver</title><link>/2021/10/snapshot-test-your-postgresql-in-golang-pgx-driver/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 14:28:23 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2021/10/snapshot-test-your-postgresql-in-golang-pgx-driver/</guid><description>If your unit-test understand SQL syntax, you can cover many behaviors of your code without the need of starting a real DB. Want to understand Postgresql syntax? just simply import Postgresql parser to your program, https://github.com/pganalyze/pg_query_go helps you to do that.
How about using a containerized DB? Sometimes, the repository layer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much logic (maybe concat some WHERE conditions), only propagate the SQL statement to DB.
Testing with a simple containerized DB is a good option where you can:</description></item></channel></rss>
