In this series, we will show how we develop and do integration tests using local k8s. The first part will show how we simulate the HTTPS request flow to allow our Platform engineers to test their config and allow our Front-end engineers to connect their application to local server with a self-signed HTTPS certificate.</description></item></channel></rss>
