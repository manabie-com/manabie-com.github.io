This time, let&amp;rsquo;s dive a little bit deeper!
Before we start, let&amp;rsquo;s cover a brief introduction to Cucumber again, and afterward, about Playwright.

Before getting to know why we use cucumber for End-to-end testing. Let&amp;rsquo;s understand what&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end testing and cucumber are.
What is End to end testing? End to end testing (E2E testing) is a software testing method that validates the entire software. From the beginning to the end.
The purpose of end-to-end testing is to simulate how a real user interacts with the application, list out the scenarios, and test the whole software for dependencies, data integrity and communication with other systems, interfaces, network connectivity and databases to exercise complete production like scenario.</description></item></channel></rss>
