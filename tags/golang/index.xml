But it&amp;rsquo;s still rather hard for integration tests.
Here I want to introduce the method we used at Manabie to measure the code covered by our integration tests across many microservices.
About our integration tests At Manabie we use Kubernetes for container orchestration. To perform integration tests, we deploy our services, and then run a test container with a go program with a whole lot of integration tests.</description></item><item><title>Snapshot test your Postgresql in Golang pgx driver</title><link>/2021/10/snapshot-test-your-postgresql-in-golang-pgx-driver/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 14:28:23 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2021/10/snapshot-test-your-postgresql-in-golang-pgx-driver/</guid><description>If your unit-test understand SQL syntax, you can cover many behaviors of your code without the need of starting a real DB. Want to understand Postgresql syntax? just simply import Postgresql parser to your program, https://github.com/pganalyze/pg_query_go helps you to do that.
How about using a containerized DB? Sometimes, the repository layer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much logic (maybe concat some WHERE conditions), only propagate the SQL statement to DB.
Testing with a simple containerized DB is a good option where you can:</description></item></channel></rss>
