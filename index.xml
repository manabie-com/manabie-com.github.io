The traffic on production is not that high. For each cluster (of each clients), it barely reaches 100 rpc on our Grafana dashboard, and everything looks safe. But no, we realize that in our roadmap, we have a plan to merge all the cluster into a multi-tenant cluster. We don&amp;rsquo;t know if the cluster merge will affect some resources, maybe there are extensively used features that we will not be aware of (features team are rapidly adding more APIs, as the business grows) and we may encouter performance issues unprepared.</description></item><item><title>Set up NATS multi-tenant in golang</title><link>/2022/03/set-up-nats-multi-tenant-in-golang/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 10:00:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2022/03/set-up-nats-multi-tenant-in-golang/</guid><description>In this blog post, we will learn how to set up NATS Multi-tenancy in golang.
NATS-Jetstream NATS has a built-in distributed persistence system called Jetstream which features new functionalities and higher qualities of service on top of the base Core NATS functionalities and qualities of service.
Jetstream was created to solve the problems identified with streaming technologies today. Some technologies address these better than others, but no current streaming technology is truly multi-tenant, horizontally scalable,&amp;hellip; Today I just talk how we can set up NATS multi-tenancy in golang.</description></item><item><title>Self-hosting Unleash with Kubernetes</title><link>/2022/01/unleash-self-host/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 21:24:00 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2022/01/unleash-self-host/</guid><description>In this blog post, we will learn how to self-host Unleash in a Kubernetes cluster.
Why feature toggles? While developing new features for our end-users, we often encounter these 2 problems:
Features are not developed and rolled out in a single night. It often takes several days or even weeks before a feature is fully developed, tested, and deployed. In such cases, we usually have to deploy a piece of that feature to production, and we would need to hide that piece until the feature is fully completed and ready.</description></item><item><title>Create feature flags using file in Unleash</title><link>/2022/01/manage-list-flags-with-file/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 14:28:23 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2022/01/manage-list-flags-with-file/</guid><description>Have you ever struggle having an overview of the feature toggles across your services and applications, especially when you have a lot on the table? We&amp;rsquo;ve been there before! In this blog, let&amp;rsquo;s learn how to create a list of feature toggles in Unleash using file. But first, let&amp;rsquo;s learn some concept of feature toggle and Unleash
What is feature toggle (feature flag)? Feature toggle (Feature flag) is a technique that allows you to disable some functionality of your application, through settings, without having to deploy new code.</description></item><item><title>How to use Playwright in cucumberjs</title><link>/2021/12/how-to-use-playwright-in-cucumberjs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 10:45:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>/2021/12/how-to-use-playwright-in-cucumberjs/</guid><description>In our previous blog article HERE, we explained why we&amp;rsquo;re using Cucumber for E2E test at Manabie, and provided a brief understanding about Cucumber.
This time, let&amp;rsquo;s dive a little bit deeper!
Before we start, let&amp;rsquo;s cover a brief introduction to Cucumber again, and afterward, about Playwright.
Cucumber Cucumber is a tool that supports Behaviour-Driven Development(BDD), If you’re new to Behaviour-Driven Development read BDD introduction first.
Cucumberjs is an open-source software testing tool written in Javascript, while the tests are written in Gherkin, a non-technical and human-readable language.</description></item><item><title>Running Flutter integration tests in Docker</title><link>/2021/12/running-flutter-integration-tests-in-docker/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 09:49:36 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2021/12/running-flutter-integration-tests-in-docker/</guid><description>Running Flutter integration tests in Docker Prerequisite Linux OS Installing: Flutter Docker Docker compose KVM https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation Technologies Flutter:

But it&amp;rsquo;s still rather hard for integration tests.
Here I want to introduce the method we used at Manabie to measure the code covered by our integration tests across many microservices.
About our integration tests At Manabie we use Kubernetes for container orchestration. To perform integration tests, we deploy our services, and then run a test container with a go program with a whole lot of integration tests.</description></item><item><title>Why we use Cucumber for end-to-end testing?</title><link>/2021/12/why-we-use-cucumber-for-end-to-end-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 14:37:23 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2021/12/why-we-use-cucumber-for-end-to-end-testing/</guid><description>Why we use Cucumber for end-to-end testing? Before getting to know why we use cucumber for End-to-end testing. Let&amp;rsquo;s understand what&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end testing and cucumber are.
What is End to end testing? End to end testing (E2E testing) is a software testing method that validates the entire software. From the beginning to the end.
The purpose of end-to-end testing is to simulate how a real user interacts with the application, list out the scenarios, and test the whole software for dependencies, data integrity and communication with other systems, interfaces, network connectivity and databases to exercise complete production like scenario.</description></item><item><title>Simulate Let’s Encrypt certificate issuing in local Kubernetes</title><link>/2021/11/simulate-https-certificates-acme-k8s/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 14:28:23 +0700</pubDate><guid>/2021/11/simulate-https-certificates-acme-k8s/</guid><description>We write test to make sure our code work as expected, no matter that a Go code or YAML config. In this series, we will show how we develop and do integration tests using local k8s.

Want to understand Postgresql syntax? just simply import Postgresql parser to your program, https://github.com/pganalyze/pg_query_go helps you to do that.
How about using a containerized DB? Sometimes, the repository layer doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much logic (maybe concat some WHERE conditions), only propagate the SQL statement to DB.
Testing with a simple containerized DB is a good option where you can:</description></item></channel></rss>
